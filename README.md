==================

This repository contains PDF scans of the VIPER newsletter.

VIPER was a hobbyist newsletter published between 1978 and 1984 focusing on
RCA’s COSMAC VIP computer. Founded by Aresco, its early editors were Terry
Laudereau, Rick Simpson, and Tom Swan. In 1981, the newsletter’s publication was
continued by the VIP Hobby Computer Association (VIPHCA) under editor Ray Sills.
VIPHCA ceased publishing VIPER in September of 1984.
